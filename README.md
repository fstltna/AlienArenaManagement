# Alien Arena Management Console (1.2)
Allows you to manage your Alien Arena server with a text based GUI -  Official support sites: [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/fstltna/AlienArenaManagement) - [Official Forum](https://fps.gameplayer.club/index.php/forum/utilities)

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- cpan -i UI::Dialog
- cpan -i Term::ReadKey
- cpan -i Term::ANSIScreen

Run "aamc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.aamcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within aamc itself.

You also need to have my Alien Arena Startup Script and Alien Arena Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (AlienArenaManagement) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version aamc as updates come out.
